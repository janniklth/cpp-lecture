# CPP Lecture

This repository contains my work and exercises for the CPP lecture of my IT-Automotive study. The project and exercises were developed to learn about the C++ programming language and programming basics like clean code, object oriented programming and test driven development. This readme file provides a brief description of the project and instructions for installation and usage.

## Project Description - NOCH Ã„NDERN

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive C++ application that demonstrates various concepts of the programming language. It consists of a collection of sample programs that illustrate different features and concepts of C++. The examples range from basic constructs like variables and loops to more advanced topics such as inheritance and polymorphism.

## Installation

To run the project on your local system, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/janniklth/cpp-lecture.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```
   cd CPP-Lecture
   ```

3. Open the `CMakeLists.txt` file in a text editor and add the desired `main.cpp` file to the list of source files. For example:  
   ```
   add_executable(main main.cpp)
   ```

4. Compile the project using CMake:  
   ```
   cmake .
   make
   ```

## Usage

After successfully compiling the project, you can use the generated executable to run the various C++ sample programs. Simply execute the following command:

```
./main
```

The program will start, and you will be provided with instructions for selecting and running the different example programs. Follow the prompts to execute the desired examples.
